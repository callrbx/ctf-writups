# CTF Writups
My humble collection of CTF writups/walkthroughs.

Many CTF writeups tend to be little more than a small explanation of the solve script, or even worse, just the script with no comments.

While these are generally fine if you worked on the problem and have some experience in the area, they can make learning from scratch difficult. To that end, this repo is an attempt to make actual teaching lessons in reverse engineering and exploit dev.

I consider myself to be about a B- CTFer, but hopefully through these I can deepen my own knowledge, while providing materials so others can further educate themselves as well.

I probably wont do a writeup for all challenges, but if I find something interesting, or think it has a great teaching opportunity, I'll make an effort to produce a good lesson.

I'm probably wrong on a lot of stuff; if you notice some hubris please make an issue.
